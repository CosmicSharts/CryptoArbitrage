<div class="container-fluid">Firstly thanks for visiting my website.I'm Kaan and i want to improve myself in the field of software.
    During the pandemic i started to take an interest in economics.
    I started to think of projects where I could realize these two passions at the same time.
    Then i found that idea and search other crypto arbitrage web sites.
    I found really good web sites and apps most of people doing arbitrage with bots,it is obviously my website can't competitive with them
    But my primary goal is to improve myself in the field of software.
    Although the project has no future, this can remain a website I developed for myself.
    I think I've learned a lot since I started the project.
    I use Python,HTML,CSS,Bootstrap4,Javascript and JQuery.
