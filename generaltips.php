            Crypto arbitrage is oppurtunity for make a good profits with low risks.I can never say it will be easy.
            There are many parameters involved, such as time,exchange fees,market situation, risk perception, the volume of the market you trade, the type of arbitrage you do.
            There are 3 different types of arbitrage <br> <br>
            1-Spatial arbitrage:This arbitrage involves buy cryptos in one exchange and sell another exchange in a quick time <br>
            2-Convergence arbitrage:This arbitrage involves buy crypto in one exchange and sold short in another exchange till prices get equal <br>
            3-Triangular arbitrage:This arbitrage a little bit complicated.In triangular arbitrage investor trade on crypto currencies with different foreign currencies.
            For example investor have an USDT,if investor catch an oppurtunity on TRY-BTC and BTC-GBP pairs,investor should swap money to TRY and buy BTC,after sell on GBP price and lastly swap to GBP-USDT
            <br><br>
            Triangular arbitrage is one of the most profitable arbitrage type.For now you can do an triangular arbitrage in Binance exchange in this web site but i try to build it for other exchanges 
            <br><br>
            When doing arbitrage you always consider about;
            <br><br>
            -Time:Exchange with slower transaction time, could be a lot of trouble for investors.Always avoid to doing arbitrage with low cap and unsafe exchange
            <br><br>
            -Exchange fees:With doing arbitrage,investors already make less profit in less time.Investors always should consider to exchange fees.<a href="">Here is a link for fees</a> 
            <br><br>
            -Risk Perception:Since the cryptocurrency industry is very open to speculation, I recommend that you always consider the risk of the market crashing.
            In addition, the risk perceptions of an investor with 1 million dollars and a thousand dollars,can be very different from each other.
            I recommend that all investors,always think twice about the transactions you make and for first time try with small amounts of money.
            <br><br>
            -Trading Volume:I recommend that you always look at the market volumes when doing arbitrage,
             otherwise you may not be able to sell the crypto you bought.(This generally happen in low cap exchanges)

            <br><br>
            -In triangular arbitrage investor convert his money 4 times this mean investor pay for fees 4 times.In Binance investor should consider to profit>0.6
